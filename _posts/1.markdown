I'd like to quickly lay out why I've started this blog. 

I've journaled off and on for a while (>3 years) but haven't found it particularly conducive to personal growth. It's not _bad_ per se, but certainly not _useful_. It lets me record my daily activities, which is certainly nice - but mostly of value to an old, senile, and nostalgic version of myself. I'd rather use writing as an opportunity to re-examine my thoughts and encourage a more thoughtful worldview. 

I aim to use this blog as a space to:
* talk about things I've read
* share photos
* talk about life-events that occur on a broader time scale than day-to-day (a la grad school stuff)
* update family members, maybe? As long as I don't write anything terribly embarrassing...
* get smarter

Anti-climactic first post. It's a start though. Let's hope it's habit forming.
